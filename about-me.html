    <h1>About Me</h1>
    I am a highly motivated and enthusiastic learner who has a strong interest in the aerospace engineering industry and a passion in helping other students succeed.
    <br>
    <br>
    For many years, I was always excited towards the idea of space exploration. As a result, my long term goal as an engineering student is to use new, innovative ideas and revolutionary technology to push the boundaries in space sustainability, and eventually make a positive impact on society.
    <br>
    <br>
    I also enjoy helping other students succeed, which came from my love of learning, and therefore I'd like to share this passion to other students. As a result, I always aim to create resources that are as accessible as possible, creating affordable content on different platforms such as educational forums or marketing numerous resources on social media. This has enabled me to not only help thousands of students (both high school and university), but also create a community with other students who have similar interests.
    <br>
    <br>
    Because I am always excited to learn, I am always keen to connect with people from different backgrounds and learn from their experiences.
